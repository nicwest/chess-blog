Hey there! My name is Nic West and I'm planning on travelling the world and
playing a lot of chess over the next year or so. I'm going to use this blog to
document my adventures and hopefully provide some useful information for
people wanting to do something similar (and/or provide evidence to my mum that
I'm not dead yet)

If you want a brief intro to my background and motivations, start with
