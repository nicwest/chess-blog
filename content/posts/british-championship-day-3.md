Day three at [the British Chess Championships 2023:
Weekender](https://chess-results.com/tnr790667.aspx?lan=1) again started at
09:15. I woke up pretty early and read some of _The Tactical Grob_ thinking it
might be a bit ballsy to play it in the morning game. I chickened out pretty
quickly and spent half an hour or so doing puzzles. I checked out of the
hotel (fun fact: hotels will hang on to your luggage for you even if you have
checked out, avoids dragging the stuff around with you all day!) and went to
grab some breakfast. I bought a banana but end up saving it for lunch. 

My first game (back on board 7) was against a guy who was at his first
tournament like me. He played a scilian and I very quickly got myself into
trouble pushing pawns in a way I don't understand. By move 9 my opponents
position was a tight coordinated unit, and my position was a complete
shambles. I think he let me back into the game with an out of place move of a
knight to the H-file but I then made a stupid blunder and lost my knight for
nothing. I tried a fair desperate attack down the H-file but was forced to
trade queens and the rest was a formality. 

This is my second frustrating game playing against the Sicilian and I really
don't feel comfortable with this a3 b4 gambit. I need to look for something
else to play. Here's the game:

   either Nc6 or e6. } (2... Nc6 3. b4 cxb4 4. axb4 Nxb4 5. c3 Nc6 6. d4)

horse and bishop I could do the same thing against another pawn. This also
shut down Nc6. } (3. Nc3 { I could try for a nice vienna? }) (3. Bb5+ { this
just lets him develop I think } 3... Bd7 4. Bc4) (3. d4 cxd4 4. Qxd4 Nc6 5.

is a line where the knight goes to d7 where you respond with moving the bishop
to g2. I don't remember the idea or the line though. }) 4... Ngf6 5. Nc3 g6 6.

this fork :( } 8. Qe2 O-O 9. Nf3 Nh5 { this felt like a mistake. The idea I
think was 9. Nxe5 Bxe5 10. ... Nf4. but letting me take on e5 lets me remove
his powerful knight, then I can defend the f4 square } { [%csl Gf4][%cal

As I finished my first game of the day in record time I had 4 hours to kill in
Leicester. The near by second hand bookshop was shut (sunday), and failing to
convince a new friend to play some chess, I ended up heading back into the
town centre and got a hair cut. I'd probably not had my hair cut since early
covid (2020), and it had got loooong. I decided to shave it all off which was
fun for everyone involved. I'm now sporting a recently convicted and getting
sent to Australia circa 1801 look.  Several kilo's lighter, I ate my banana
and headed back to the venue for the last game of the tournament.

My last game was on board 15 with a cool guy and we chatted a bit before the
game. He's an astronomer so we commiserated about the night sky in london, and
he told me to watch out for an interesting meteor shower in the next few
weeks.

He played the Kings Indian Attack which I'd heard of but never seen in person
before (I didn't recognise it in the game he told afterwards). I'm a Pirc
player so it's normally me that is giving away the centre and trying to win it
back. I played `1. ... d5` instead of the usual `1. ... d6` and just hoped no
one would notice. After a few more developing moves from both sides I ended
up with what felt like a nice position and *two* whole pawns in the centre
nicely supported by my minor pieces. When my opponent finally did strike back
in the centre I was able to fabricate a somewhat dubious fork and trade my
knight for a rook. Up material I traded down to a nice trick to win his
bishop, and my first over the board checkmate!

My opponent was kind enough to sit down in the analysis room afterwards and go
through the game in some detail. I think the conclusion was the decisive fork
was probably flawed and the game would have been a lot closer if the centre
had stayed locked.

I ended my first standard tournament with a record of 3 wins and two
losses and a performance rating of 1488. Considering I was expecting to lose
all my games and go home crying, I will take that outcome! I enjoyed the
tournament experience, staying in hotel was fun and Leicester was a bit meh
but not terrible in the grand scheme of things. 

I stayed to watch a bit of the actual championship games which was actually a
lot more fun in person than online and hung out in the commentary box for 20
minutes or so. I suspect that chess commentators and cricket commentators have
a fair amount in common considering the amount of time they have to fill!

Finally I headed back to the hotel grabbed my bags, headed to the train
station, and went home to London.
