![Everything is fine](https://media.tenor.com/vxFNoJHV3I4AAAAC/chiquichico.gif)

My name is Nic West, I've just turned 35, and I am about to quit my job to
travel the world and play chess.

Why?!
-----

I have an addictive personality, and this lead to some fairly serious
alcohol issues in my early twenties. I quit, and as I dried out, I replaced
getting drunk every day with the high drama roller coaster of the start-up
world. I jumped seamlessly from the frying pan and into the fire. Work sort of
consumed me, I would work late and at weekends, and think about work stuff all
the time. I stopped regular exercise, and my eating habits (not particularly
good to begin with) took a nose dive. As I became a better at my job, I kept
getting more stuff to do that I wasn't as good at. This caused a bunch of
stress and anxiety.

Are your warning lights flashing yet?  Sadly the bulbs in mine were out.

Fast forward a decade or so as I turn 35 and my body is starting to misbehave.
Bits of me hurt when they shouldn't, I can't sleep, my eyesight is
deteriorating rapidly, and I've got grey hairs sprouting from every part of my
body. I think it's safe to say I've been flirting with the dreaded start-up
burnout. I have seen where that path leads, and that is **not** a place I
want to go.

So I've handed in my notice and I'm planning to take at least some form of
break between this job and the next one. Probably a long break. 

OK... But chess?

So the chess component here comes in two parts.

Almost exactly a year ago (July 2022) youtube started recommending me chess
youtube videos to watch. I was hooked pretty much straight away, I signed up
on [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/nic_west), and I've been playing
almost every day since (although I now play on
[lichess.org](https://lichess.org/@/nic_west)). 

I joined a local chess club and 

Travelling for travellings sake has never really had much interest for me. I
think I got over travelled when I was young. I like getting on planes, and
staying in hotels, and eating different food, but going to new places just to
see new things and say "I've been there" feels like a waste of time. Maybe
I've lived a little too much of  my life on the internet and the real world
just doesn't have the same appeal.
