Day 2 of the tournament started at 09:15 which traditionally is a pretty scary
time for me. I woke up earlier that I wanted at 07:00 and decided since I was
awake anyway [I would go for a
run](https://www.strava.com/activities/9497622504).  I'm a big fat man.
Running for me is about trying to stave off an early heart attack, it's not
about going far or fast. I keep hearing how important physical fitness is for
chess from people that sound like they know what they are talking about so
maybe it will help me there as well.

I picked up another sandwich and headed to venue.

Oh wait lets talk about pens and writing stuff down.

At the rapid play tournament I played at last month, score sheets were just
for personal use, many players didn't bother writing down their games, and
towards the end of the day the organiser was running pretty low on paper. I
assumed this was the case in all tournaments and brought my own chess game
note book from the chess and bridge shop in Baker street. I also bought some
nice felt tip pens that I saw someone at my club use and liked the look of.

However yesterday the tournament organisers said we had to write down every
move (even in time trouble) and when the game was completed we had to tear off
the duplicate sheet, sign it, and hand it in. What they are doing with the
duplicates I have no idea. I'm going to assume it's what chess arbiters eat.

Anyway my felt tips didn't provide enough pressure to transcribe to the
duplicate sheet and I sheepishly had to borrow a biro yesterday. So in
addition to my breakfast I picked up a ball point pen so I could pretend to be
a pro chess player. Lesson Learnt!

I made it to the venue with a comfortable 10 minutes to spare and found that
after my win yesterday I was playing white on board 7 against the 10th seed
who was rated 1444K. He was also a grown up with a bunch of games under his
belt which yet again had me worried!

I opened with `1. e4` hoping to play the vienna where I feel pretty confident.
Alas `1. ... d4` the Scandi followed, which I'm ok with online but I think
against someone that plays this a lot, competitively I'm probably at a massive
disadvantage. I took the pawn and then panicked when he played `2.
... Nf6` which is not something I've seen before. I spent the next couple of
moves playing "defend the pawn, no no wait develop something, ANYTHING!",
before catching a break and my opponent blundered a full bishop on move 6
followed by a pawn on move 10. Talking after the game it sounded like he just
missed that I had deviated from the line he was expecting and played a move on
auto pilot. I've been there, I know how it feels and I feel for the guy. Up a
bunch of material I still didn't feel like the game was in bag until he
resigned on move 28.


Here's the game. Annotations are mine, I've not looked at it with a computer
yet.

1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6!? { I've not seen this version of the scandi before, I
   panicked at little. } 3. c4 (3. Bb5+ c6 (3... Bd7 4. Bxd7+ (4. a4 Bxb5 5.

4... Bxe6 5. Nf3 { just trying to develop in leiu of knowing what to do. }
5... Qe7 6. Qe2 { I played this and didn't really think much about the
ramifications. my idea was blocking with the bishop loses the pawn, whereas
blocking with the queen pins the bishop to the queen and at worst I get to
capture the queen with check and a tempo even if it means I have to give back
the pawn. } 6... Bxc4?? { I think it was obvious to everyone this was a pretty
big fuck up. He told me afterwards that he for some reason thought I had
blocked with the bishop and was playing on auto pilot. } 7. Qxe7+ Bxe7 8. Bxc4
{ now just trade everything off and win the game. } 8... Nc6 9. Nc3 { develop
} 9... O-O-O 10. Bxf7 { free pawn! } 10... Nb4 11. Be6+ { this was convoluted,
better I think was simply to do Bb3. After the game Michael said he thought he
had trapped my rook. I don't really see it. } (11. Bb3) 11... Kb8 12. Bf5 g6
13. Bb1 a6 14. a3 Nc6 15. b4 Rhe8 16. O-O Rd7 17. b5 axb5 18. Nxb5 { my idea
was just to trade material when I could. I'm up a lot, if we just trade off
safely then I should come out a piece and pawn up and the endgame should be
winning comfortably } 18... Rd5 19. a4 Bb4 20. Nc3 Rh5 (20... Bxc3 21. dxc3 {
felt like a good trade for me. }) 21. Ba3 Ba5 22. Bc2 { finally finishing
development } { [%csl Gb5][%cal Gc3b5,Ga4b5,Ga1b1,Gb1b5] } 22... Na7 23. Rab1

felt ok } 25... Rh8 { this felt bad } (25... Rd8) 26. Be5 Bd8 27. Ne4 Rf8 28.

Holy shit I won another game. What the hell was going on. Maybe it's the power
of Bananas? I decided not to eat one before the next game for science.

I had 3 hours to kill so I walked around Leicester town centre for a bit.

I recently listened to an episode of [the perpetual chess podcast
with Stjepan Tomić](https://www.perpetualchesspod.com/new-blog/2019/3/12/episode-117-stjepan-tomi-adult-improver-series)
(who I liked alot btw) and he talked about building up a library of chess
books by searching second hand shops. I thought this was a cool idea so I
headed out to find a second hand book shop to see if I could find anything
interesting and I feel like I struck gold with *"The Tactical Grob"* by Claude F.
Bloodgood. The book is about 50 pages long and while it doesn't have a date it
is old enough to still be in descriptive notation (which I actually quite like).
I also suspect it predates widespread usage of computers as black appears to
have a -1.49 advantage within 4 moves of the mainline. It's got a funny name
though so that puts it firmly on my to read list. Also Bloodgood's probably
got some good advice on what sword to buy or how to kill vampires or
something.

**New rule**: if I'm going somewhere, I'm going to try and track down and read
an old chess book. Maybe I can even review them here at some point! Come
september I'm going to have a lot time on my hands.

Also I bought some combat shorts from an army surplus store (not strictly
chess related I guess), and went for a posh lunch in a restaurant before
heading back to the venue. **I did not eat any bananas**.

In round three I was playing black against the 3rd seed (rated 1495) on the
2nd board. I was tied for the lead of our section with about 10 others, and
playing board 2 felt fairly surreal.

Another `1. e4` game (I'm going to play `1. ... d6` against everything, but at
least when I do it against `1. e4` I look like I know what I'm doing). I
played `1. ... d6` and this time got the standard  response of `2. d4 Nf6 3.
Nc3` which allowed me to play my new move `3. ... e5` inviting a trade of
queens and an immediate middle/endgame. This is the first chapter of the book
I'm reading at the moment ["Play 1. ... d6 against everything" by Erik Zude &
Jörg Hickl](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Play-Against-Everything-Ready-Use/dp/9056917447/).
My opponent played into it and I'm fairly certain I came out of the opening
with an advantage. I think we might have been following a Magnus Carlson game
for a little bit which was cool a) because that means I'm basically Magnus now
and b) because I can remember that. I was able to squeeze the position with my
rooks and a pushed a pawn, and I feel like a had a fairly decisive advantage.
Then I made two fairly massive blunders in quick succession under no time
pressure to lose the game.

1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 e5 { This is the opening I've been learning, I only
   really know the endgame variation (the Atoshkin variation is the next
chapter I'm going to read). A lot of pirc books don't really go into much
detail on this other than saying something along the lines of "4. ... dxe5 is
a boring endgame". Might be true for high level players but I'm enjoying it.
The books is "Play d6 against everything" by Erik Zude and Jorg Hickl } 4.
dxe5 dxe5 5. Qxd8+ Kxd8 { the plan is to develop like this in whatever order
makes sense at the time: Be6, Bd6, Nbd7, Ke7 or Kc8. The king is pretty safe
and you can slowly work your way up the board. } 6. Bg5 { this line is
apparently the scary one. } (6. Bc4 Be6 7. Bxe6 fxe6) 6... Be6 7. O-O-O+ Bd6 {
so I think I fucked up here and I should've developed the knight first. Nb5 is
annoying and I really don't want to trade off my dark squared bishop for a
Knight. } 8. Nf3 { he let me off the hook with this move which I believe is a
slight inaccuracy. The pawn break on the f file is important and this move
blocks it and without much to show for it. } 8... Nd7 { Nb5 is still available
and perhaps I should have shut it down earlier. I'm fairly certain there is a
Magnus game in the book from this position and the person he was playing
against went Nb5, Magus allowed him to take the bishop and then Magnused him.
I'm not Magnus and the last time I tried this I lost both bishops and the
game. Nxe5 had to be stopped though. } 9. Kb1 { presumably to free up the N on
c3 from defending the a2 pawn. } 9... a6 { shutting down the attacks on my
dark sq bishop. } 10. Nd2 h6 { kick the light sq bishop } 11. Bh4 g5 12. Bg3
Ke7 { completing the plan. and I think I have a slight lead in the development
} 13. a3 b5 { shutting down the d2 knight. } 14. Nb3 b4 { I thought about this
for a while. it looked safe and I could deal with Nd5 so this cleared the a
file for my pawn. } 15. axb4 Bxb4 16. Nd5+ Nxd5 17. exd5 Bf5 18. Bd3 { my nice
compact position seems to have suddenly dissolved which wasn't the plan. }
18... Bxd3 { the trade seemed ok but maybe there was something else here. I
think I should have recognised that I was fully out of book here and spent
more time looking for another option. } (18... Bg4?? 19. f3) 19. Rxd3 Kd6 { I
think I saw a youtube video where the presenter describe this as "wearing the
pawn like a helmet to defend you from rooks" It made me laugh. } 20. c3 Bc5
21. Nxc5 Nxc5 { trading my bishop for a knight feels yucky but his bishop was
in jail and I got a tempo attacking the rook so maybe it's ok. } 22. Re3 {
[%cal Rg3e5,Re3e5,Bf7f6,Bc5d7,Rd6d5] } 22... f6 23. Rd1 a5 { Again I'm still
playing moves quickly here. The a-file felt like a winner to me so pushing
that pawn made sense } 24. f3 { frees the bishop } 24... a4 25. c4 { could I
have stopped this? probably should have spent the time to find out. } 25...
Rhb8 { [%cal Ba4a3] } (25... a3 26. bxa3 Rhb8+ 27. Kc2 Rb3 (27... Rb6 28. Rb1
Rab8 29. Rxb6+ cxb6) 28. Rxb3) 26. Ra3 Rb3 (26... Rb4 { this was probably
better. I saw it after I moved. } 27. Rc1 Nb3 28. Rc3 Nd2+ 29. Kc2 Nxc4) 27.
Rxb3 Nxb3 { I think this was wrong, better was to take with the pawn } (27...
axb3 { This feels a bunch better } 28. Rc1 Ra4 29. Rc3 { I just couldn't see
what to do from here, my attack felt dead, even if I did have a good position.
}) 28. Bf2 Ra5 29. Be1 Rc5?? { this was a stupid move that should have been
caught with a checklist and it cost me the game. I am in fact bad at chess. }
30. Bb4 Na5 (30... c6 31. dxc6+ Kxc6 32. Bxc5 Kxc5 33. Rd7 Kxc4 34. Rf7 Nd2+
35. Kc2) 31. Rc1 Nb3 32. Rc3 Nd2+ 33. Kc2 Nxc4 34. Rxc4 Kxd5 35. Rxc5+ { 1-0
White wins. } 1-0

I actually feel pretty good about this game even though I lost. I think I
played well (untill I didn't) and the reason I lost the game was because I did
something stupid, that I know and understand was stupid and I'm actively
working on fixing it.  Would it have been nice to win another game, go 3 for 3
and play on the top board for all the marbles tomorrow? For sure, but it's
really not the end of the world.

Also in a result for science we now know that banana consumption is highly
correlated with chess success. I'm going for a beer in the hotel bar to
celebrate.

Here are my costs today. I suspect this might be more useful in a spreadsheet
form and without the random "but I still have a well paying job" purchases, but
yet here we are...
