I've won my first game of over the board slow chess! I'm playing in my club's
summer tournament (5 games, 75/15 format).

I lost my first game to young player called Joshua. He likes to play weird
stuff and I was just not prepared for someone going `1.e4 f4`. He played
quickly and I basically fell apart after the first couple of moves.

I'm not super proud of this performance, but my take away from this game was
not to get flustered by someone playing quickly and when I get into positions
I'm not familiar with to take some time and ensure that I'm playing principled
and sensible moves. Losing a game with 50 minutes left on the clock feels not
good. Also when I see this gambit I know that taking the pawn is winning.

My second game was with another Josh, a player new to the club. He had
basically picked me apart 3 times the week before, so I wasn't too optimistic
about winning this game.

If I thought about it I actually would have known that Josh was going to play
the Sicilian, and I could have prepared better. I didn't though and he played
it.

Currently I'm playing a wing gambit against the Sicilian that Gotham chess
recommends in his otherwise awesome ["E4 New York
Style"](https://chessly.com/courses/812a7981-0439-4de4-a86b-35b9833eea25)
course, and I REALLY don't like it. In comparison to the rest of my opening
repertoire it's very pawn centric and very sharp with a lot of theory and
ideas I've not really digested properly yet. Find something more straight
forward is pretty high on my todo list. Gotham also suggest the Snyder
variation with 2. Bb2.

Probably because I don't really understand this opening Josh ended up crushing
me right up to the point where he left his knight hanging and I was able to
trade down to a winning endgame. I got lucky and winning this game had very
little to do with me. Pretty much every move I made made my position weaker.
So yay! On the plus side I didn't horribly blunder anything or leave a pawn
hanging which probably marks some kind of progress. 

I'd missed the important tactic after **`6. ... g6 7. b6 axb6 8. Nb5`**

I feel for Josh. He should have won this game and I should have lost it.

All that being said it feels good to get a win.
