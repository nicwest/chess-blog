I played round 3 of [our club's](https://www.metchess.org/) summer tournament
on Thursday. I'm currently on 1 loss and 1 lucky win. We don't play a lot of
slow chess at the club in this setting and I've enjoyed the games.

Tom is a new face to me but seems like a nice guy, we have almost identical
ratings 1388K vs 1388P which made me smile. I didn't know what to expect but
hoped for a good game.

He opened with `1. d4` which I actually don't see that often, and when I
do it's normally the London, and I just play a pirc and try and be as
disruptive as possible to someone playing a system. However after `1. d4 d6 2.
c4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6` I believe we would then be playing a Kings Indian Defence
rather than the Pirc and while similar I don't play that opening all
that often and I'm not sure on what ideas work and which don't.

Instead I decided a while ago that I was going to play `2. ... e5`
in response to this and transpose the unsuspecting victim in to [The English
Rat](https://lichess.org/opening/Rat_Defense_English_Rat). This has the added
benefit of covering off both the `1. d4` and `1. c4` starting moves with one
set of theory. It's actually the reason why I picked up the [_Play d6 against
everything
book_](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Play-Against-Everything-Ready-Use/dp/9056917447)
as it goes into detail on how to play a rat defence against the english.

Sadly I've not actually read more than the first few paragraphs of that
chapter as it said something along the lines of "Many lines transpose back
into the Old Indian opening, which is fine because you have read the rest of
this book and you are super familiar with the ideas there and your opponent
probably isn't". So I played `2. ... e5` only to realise that I was now out of
book!

![awkward monkey meme]({{<static "/imgs/awkward-monkey.gif" >}})

I thought that the position after trading off the queens wasn't going to be
that different from the endgame pirc I've been playing recently, the only
difference being the pawn on c4 rather than e4, and that c-pawn was going to
block the light squared bishop from developing properly. So I continued with
the normal plan of developing `Be6 Nbd7 Bd6 Ke7` and see what happens.

The game went well, looking back over it with a computer I had an advantage
pretty much the whole game and I left a lot of totally crushing moves on the
table. I miscalculated a critical position however and Tom had calculated
it perfectly, and it led to him being up a rook and pawn to my bishop. I
fought on for a little bit before admitting defeat.

1. d4 d6 2. c4 { I forgot to ask my opponent what opening he was playing, I
   suspect he was expecting a KID } 2... e5 { so I'm a sucker for openings
with a cool name, and "The English Rat" both sounds cool and dosesn't appear
to be totally dumb. Sadly this is sum total of all the theory I know for this.
It's in the "Play d6 against everything" book but I've not got to that chapter
yet... } 3. dxe5 dxe5 4. Qxd8+ Kxd8 5. e4 Nf6 6. Bd3 Be6 { I decided this is
similar to the endgame pirc, but with an advanced c-pawn. I figured that was
cramping the light squared bishop and I would be fine continuing normal
development. } 7. Nf3 Nbd7 8. O-O { I'm expecting O-O-O. I'm not sure if there
are any examples of O-O in the book will have to check again. } 8... Bd6 9. a3

the b4 pawn break probably was a sensible idea } 10. b4 axb4 11. axb4 Rxa1)

feel awful cramped }) 11. Be3 cxb4 (11... b6 12. bxc5 bxc5 13. Nc3 Rab8 14.

total nightmare. } 19... Nb5 20. Nd2 Rc8 21. Rc1 f6 22. Nef3 { this was
probably the last place I felt like had a slight edge. } 22... Kf7 { this move
was unnecessary. I was worried about Re1+ after I moved my bishop. but actually
I could always have moved out of that check or blocked again with the bishop,
so I probably gave up a tempo here } 23. h3 Rd8 { I don't know was the idea
was here? } 24. Rb1 Bd7 { only move I could find to defend both the knight and
the pawn } 25. Nc4 Re8 { I was worried about a sac on e5 winning my bishop.

Tom hung out and we went over the game afterwards. I was pretty clear he had a
much better handle on the critical position than I did.

I finished this game with over an hour left on my clock and lost because I
didn't analyse a position accurately. Additionally I missed bunch of decent
moves that were 100% findable if I just spent the time to look for them. This
is a problem and I need to work on it.

Also just for the record I ate a banana on route to the club, HOWEVER, Tom ate
one mid game at around about the time that crushed me. This started as a joke
but now I'm seriously beginning to believe in the power of the banana.

On the plus side the first outing with the Rat Defence was a fun adventure and
worth exploring further.
