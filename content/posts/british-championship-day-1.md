I'm playing in the [British Chess Championships 2023: Weekender Yates
U1500](https://chess-results.com/tnr790667.aspx?lan=1)
in Leicester (UK). It's a big tournament and I'm playing in lowest division of
the weekend congress.

Prior to this I've only played in [one rapid play
tournament](https://chess-results.com/tnr765495.aspx?lan=1). So this
will be my first standard chess tournament and my first tournament played
over multiple days. Additionally it's probably the first time I've left London
under my own steam for a long time and part of the reason for this trip is
trying to get a feel for what playing chess away from home will be like.

My current ECF classical rating is 1388P (the P stands for provisional,
basically I've not played enough games to have an accurate rating). That's
based off one game I played 6 months ago and I lost it. On the entry form I
gave an estimated rating of 1100 based on my ~1400 Lichess rapid rating.

The first game started at 19:00 and could finish as late as 23:00 which sort
of blew my mind. I checked into the Holiday Inn about 10 minutes from the
venue and picked up a sandwich and a banana which I ate on the way
to the game. Trying not to be late I arrived 40 minutes early. This was
obviously a mistake and I had to sit around by myself for a while before the
game. Lesson learned!

I was seeded 44 out of 55 and my first game was as black against a Junior
called who was seeded 15th and rated 1418. I'm not going to lie, I was
both nervous and intimidated.

My opponent opened with e4 and I played a Pirc defence. It's basically the only
opening with black I feel comfortable with. I'm not playing any specific
theory but I've got an OK feel for the general ideas. My biggest issue with
the Pirc is choosing and timing the correct pawn break, I usually get it wrong
and my position collapses. This time I think I got it right, and it lead to a
comfortable position. A bit of luck (definitely luck not skill) materialised a
strong pawn break in the mid game that lead to me winning a knight for a pawn,
and that was enough to grind out a win.

Here's the game. Analysis is mine from after the game, I've not looked at this
with a computer yet, as I'm hoping to go through it with my coach.

1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Bd3 { I've recently been learning a non-pirc pirc and
   forgotten how to play against this :( } 3... g6 4. Nf3 { I think f3 is the
150 attack and I don't want to castle into it. 4. Nf3 made me feel a bit more
comfortable. (Narrator: It was not the 150 attack that's the other bishop) }
4... Bg7 5. O-O O-O 6. c3 { this felt a little sus as it blocks in either the
knight or the bishop, better would have been to develop the bishop straight
away. } 6... Bg4 { preparing e5 } 7. Bf4 Nc6 { mounting pressure on e5. } 8.

option }) 16... c6 { Truth be told I missed this until we arrived at the
position, I couldn't find a way that white could prevent the lost of the
knight } 17. Qxd6 (17. Qd4 Nf3+ 18. gxf3 Bxd4) (17. Qd2 Nxc4) (17. Qxc6 Nxc6)
17... Nxc4 { won a piece for a pawn, couldn't see any counterplay for white,
now just trying to trade off pieces, if I can trade the knight for the bishop
then even better. }

    Rab1 { I thought there might be some kind of cool queen trap here after
Ba5 and Ra8 but I couldn't find it. } 21... Qd4 { this felt risky, I looked at
a bunch of other options and I went with this as it would allow Nc4 without
losing the bishop to Rc1 } (21... Bd4 22. Be3 Bxe3 23. fxe3 Nd3 24. Rxb6)

anything. } 31... Ra1 32. Rbxb2 Rxb2 33. Rxb2 Ra5 34. e4 Kg7 35. Rb7 Kf6)

I won a game which I was not expecting! Regardless of the outcome of the
next games I can go home happy.

For future reference I'm going to try and itemise expenditure in as much
detail as possible. Part of that is for me for budgeting purposes (I'm about
to be unemployed after all!), but maybe it could be useful for others as well.

| Expense                  | Cost (£) | Detail                                                        |
|--------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Train tickets            | 96.20 <sup> * </sup>  | I came by way of Gloucester so maybe cheaper if I went direct |
| Hotel (2 nights)         | 213.60   | I don't know how to do hotels, surely there is a cheaper way.   |
| Upgrading ECF membership | 16.50    | Needed a gold level membership to play in the tournament      |
| Entry Fee                | 50.00    | £45.00 + £5 late entry fee.                                   |
| Celebratory beer<sup> * </sup> in the hotel bar  | 5.00 | 0% alch obviously
| **Total**                | **376.30**  |                                                               |
